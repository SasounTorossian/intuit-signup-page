# intuit-signup-page
Intuit signup page replica based off the Odin project curriculum. Just a styled signup page that implements a simple form. 
Live demo can be found on github.io [here](https://sasountorossian.github.io/intuit-signup-page/).

Not much to say here, except for going back to CSS basics and not making use of much flexbox. Decided to make greater use of inline, inline-block, and block styling in order to practice.
Simple project that gave a refresher on CSS concepts learned much earlier.
